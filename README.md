📦 Zepto Delivery Data Analysis — Power BI + DAX

This project explores business intelligence and data analytics for Zepto, a 10-minute grocery delivery startup. Using Power BI and DAX, I built an interactive dashboard to analyze delivery performance, customer behavior, and category trends based on simulated real-world data.

📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides key insights into:

Delivery Performance: Analyze average delivery times, late deliveries, and high-delay zones.

Customer Behavior: Segment users by frequency, basket size, and churn risk.

Category Sales Trends: Identify top-performing products, demand by time of day, and revenue by category.

Retention & Engagement: Understand how often customers return and what drives repeat purchases.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard development

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated measures and KPIs

Excel / CSV Files: Simulated dataset for analysis (orders, customers, products, deliveries)

⚙️ Features

Interactive filters by location, time period, and product category

Custom DAX measures for average delivery time, revenue per user, order frequency, etc.

Time intelligence functions for rolling averages and trend analysis

Visual breakdowns of late deliveries and customer segmentation
